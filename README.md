# CalendarToCalendar
This is an application that will let you get calendar events from Google Calendar and put them into the phone calendar. The application was written in swift. 

It is open source so anyone can use it, but please leave feadback on how it works for everyone. Any tips to make it more efficient or look nicer please let me know in the Issues tab. Also feel free to do a pull request and update the code.

One point of information is that anywhere that has an ID I left a blank String for privacy reasons, but you would need to go to adMob to make an account and all of the information is there.

I will send a link to the app when it is uploaded to the app store.
