# Calendar To Calendar
This is an application that will let you get calendar events from Google Calendar (and now Outlook Calendar) and put them into the phone calendar. The application was written in swift. 

### The app demonstrates:
* How to use Local Notifications
* How to interact with the Google Calendar API
* How to make OAuth 2 requests with an API
* How to use SwiftyJSON API
* How to implement interstitial ads with AdMob
* How to show ads on Application reload

It is open source so anyone can use it, but please leave feedback on how it works for everyone. Any tips to make it more efficient or look nicer please let me know in the Issues tab. Also feel free to do a pull request and update the code.

## Note: 
Anywhere that has an ID I left a blank String for privacy reasons, but you would need to go to adMob to make an account and all of the information in how to implement it is on the website.
